# ADR 0002: Versioning Policy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a consistent way to version the CLI tool to manage compatibility, communicate changes to users effectively, and automate releases.

## Decision

We will adhere strictly to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

### Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR (X.y.z)**: Breaking changes to CLI commands, flags, or configuration formats.
- **MINOR (x.Y.z)**: New features that are backward compatible.
- **PATCH (x.y.Z)**: Bug fixes and performance improvements.

### Pre-release Strategy

We will use pre-release tags for development iterations:

1. **Alpha (`0.1.0-alpha.x`)**: Feature complete but unstable. Internal testing.
2. **Beta (`0.1.0-beta.x`)**: Public testing. API freeze.
3. **RC (`0.1.0-rc.x`)**: Release Candidate. No new code, only critical fixes.

## Consequences

- **Predictability**: Users can rely on version numbers to know when to upgrade safely.
- **Automation**: CI pipelines can automatically parse versions to determine release channels (e.g., `alpha` -> `next` tag on npm).
