# ADR 0001: Repository Topology

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Kaven ecosystem (CLI, Framework, Marketplace, Site) requires a repository structure that supports both public contribution and private intellectual property protection.

## Decision

We will split the codebase into three distinct repositories:

1. **kaven-cli (Public)**
   - **Visibility**: Public (Apache-2.0)
   - **Scope**: CLI tool (`kaven`), public templates, community documentation.
   - **Goal**: Enable community contributions and transparent tooling.

2. **kaven-framework (Private)**
   - **Visibility**: Private
   - **Scope**: Core framework logic, SaaS backend services.
   - **Goal**: Protect core IP and SaaS infrastructure.

3. **kaven-marketplace (Private)**
   - **Visibility**: Private
   - **Scope**: Marketplace frontend, seller dashboard, billing integrations.
   - **Goal**: Separate commercial frontend from core infrastructure.

## Consequences

- **Pros**:
  - Clear separation of concerns (Tooling vs Platform vs Commercial).
  - Allows community to build tools/modules for the CLI without exposing core business logic.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires syncing shared types or contracts (solved via npm packages or git submodules).
